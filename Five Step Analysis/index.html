<h1 id="the-five-step-approach-to-analysis-in-an-extemp-speech">The Five Step Approach to Analysis in an Extemp Speech</h1>
<p>The hardest part about an extemp speech is not delivery or making yourself seem “smooth,”
rather counterintuitively, it’s answering the question. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying
the first two are easy; in fact, quite the opposite they are still hard (but still achievable through
practice, like other skills). However, what even the most revered extempers often forget to do is
answer the question. In this short article, I’m going to talk about a five-step approach that is
sequential that you can use to handle ANY question you receive—and I guarantee you will
answer the question. There’s no magic, but always a systematic way to go through a problem
helps (and every extemp question is inherently a problem!). For each of the steps, I’ve given
multiple questions as examples; but, as with any other skill, these steps require practice. As my
physics professor puts it, you can’t swim by watching another person swim, even if that’s a
good first step. Each of the steps below are modular in nature, meaning you can practice/drill
over each in isolation.</p>
<p>Overall, the purpose of this reading is to figure out how to actually execute <a href="../">the central dogma of extemp</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="1-understand-the-type-of-question-that-is-being-asked">1. Understand the type of question that is being asked</h3>
<p>In extemp there are three types of questions: solvency, prediction, and cost-benefit analysis.
EVERY single extemp question can be categorized into these three types. Let’s take a set of
example extemp questions (most are courtesy of Extemp Central) and sort them through as an
example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Solvency</strong></th>
<th><strong>Prediction</strong></th>
<th><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>How can a war between Ethiopia and Eritrea be avoided?</td>
<td>Will Donald Trump’s second term as president be less chaotic than the first?</td>
<td>Should the Department of Education be abolished?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What role, if any, should AI play in the use of nuclear weapons?</td>
<td>Were economic or cultural issues more influential in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election?</td>
<td>Should there be greater federal regulation of social media content?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>How can the U.S. revitalize gun control legislation in a Trump presidency?</td>
<td>Is Donald Trump making a mistake by not giving Nikki Haley a cabinet position?</td>
<td>Does Jerome Powell deserve another term as Federal Reserve Chairman?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Solvency questions</em> are classified by a question that asks you for a solution to a problem (and for
you to prove your solution will work—policy people, you know you love these questions!).</p>
<p><em>Prediction questions</em> are questions that ask you to either proactively or retroactively analyze a
solution and apply models (we’ll talk about these models in step 5) to spell out why you think
this will happen. These types of questions lend themselves nicely to understanding why
something occurs and if your current situation meets that criteria (step 5 will tell you more).</p>
<p><em>Cost-benefit analysis</em> otherwise known as yes/no questions (not always, though) have a policy
given to you, but requires you to evaluate whether that policy should be implemented or not
based on your own criteria (but the question may provide some too! Again step 5 will get there).</p>
<p>Now that you have figured out where your question lies in these categories, it’s time to actually
figure out why this is such a useful first step—we’ll come back to this step in way more detail in
step 5.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="2-ask-why-this-question-is-being-asked">2. Ask why this question is being asked</h3>
<p>This is such an integral question that people often forget, but actually gives the entire answer to
your intro. This is one of two elements you must address in your intro (the next one will come
up in steps 3 and 4). Let’s take “Will Donald Trump’s second term as president be less chaotic than
the first?” as an example question to analyze.</p>
<p>Now, before reading on, ask yourself the question: why, at this time, is this question being
asked? If you were paying attention to the news, you will likely say: Well, it’s November 2024,
and Trump just got re-elected. This is correct, but let’s dig deeper.</p>
<p>Often, when covering background, we stop right there (“Trump got elected that’s why”), but we
just forgot the entire second-half of the question. There is a reason they use words like “chaotic”
and second term; it means that the question implies the chaos of the first administration—we
forget details like this most of the time, but details like these are the difference between
answering “What does a second Trump administration mean?” vs. the question we are actually
given.</p>
<p>After accounting for the nuance in the question, the real why comes down to this: “Former
President Donald Trump got re-elected to a second term, after what experts called a chaotic first
term nearly four years ago, that managed to shake up foreign policy, climate policy, and the
social fabric of the nation.” Creating a banger background that covers it like this allows you to
preface your points. All of this is to say be very specific about all parts of the questions and
about the implications it makes. Now, one out of two parts of our intro are complete.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="3-pick-up-on-your-burdens-the-most-important-step">3. Pick up on your burdens (the most important step)</h3>
<p>Responding to and understanding the burdens of a given question is the make or break of
answering the question. Doing this makes a speech feel complete. It’s like going from knowing
about programming to understanding how it works under-the-hood. Burdens are what you
need to have said by the end of the speech (to that end, we will use frameworks in step 4, but
we do need to identify burdens to start). Understanding how it works under-the-hood is the
magic sauce that most extempers take time to implement. And you will likely find that
identifying burdens seems so superfluous but step 4 will actually use this. I feel that starting
with examples is the best way to begin. The blue words are your so-called burdens:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: blue;">Will</span> Donald Trump’s second term as president be <span style="color: blue;">less chaotic</span> than the first?</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: blue;">Is</span> Donald Trump making a <span style="color: blue;">mistake</span> by not giving Nikki Haley a cabinet position?</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: blue;">How</span> can the U.S. <span style="color: blue;">revitalize</span> gun control legislation in a Trump presidency?</strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="color: blue;">Does</span> Jerome Powell <span style="color: blue;">deserve</span> another term as Federal Reserve Chairman?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before reading on, I want you to look at these examples, and see what unites these terms. Do
you find the pattern?</p>
<p>The first part is the question term and each term specifies the category of question (see step 1
again for this) and what you will need to do. So, when categorizing the question, you pay
attention to this initial term. <strong>Which</strong> questions (not shown here) also carry an important burden
that I think is important to highlight, even if they might be categorized with prediction.
Specifically it introduces the burden of comparison. Immediately when seeing <strong>which</strong> you should
think of the candidates and the framework to compare—this will come together in your mind in
the next step. <span style="color: red">IMPORTANT:</span> in comparative questions, if you do not bring
up examples of other things you are comparing with, you have <span style="color: red"><strong>NOT</strong></span> answered the question.</p>
<p>The second part is, perhaps, the most important. As you will find, this is the criterion and it’s
always going to be ambiguous. “Less chaotic,” “mistake,” “revitalize,” and “deserve,” are all
terms that are ambiguous in nature but also are the intent of the question. It is your job to define
these terms in the intro (i.e., this is the second part out of the two parts of your intro’s
background (this is the most important thing). But we won’t get caught up in that yet, we will
look at how to define the word in step 4 in a way that makes your analysis so much easier by
developing a framework (LD folks, you ready?).</p>
<h4 id="a-special-note-on-can-as-a-question-wordin-the-question">A special note on “can” as a question word/in the question</h4>
<p>Sometimes you see <strong>can</strong> as a term in your question, and this gives you a ton of flexibility. Questions like “How should…” or “Is…” often have an angle of politics to them; for example, abolishing the electoral college or reforming doesn’t seem plausible in America’s political climate, so it’s not really a valid answer to the question. Yet, the word <strong>can</strong> allows for that since reforming the electoral college is still allowed even if it is improbable. “Can” is powerful because it means all resources, not usually confined by political will. </p>
<p>For more information on this, you can see my use of the word <strong>can</strong> in a strategic context in my NSDA final round speech (NSDA 2024 Speaker #4).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="4-identify-the-framework">4. Identify the framework</h3>
<p>Now, we’ll step into more detail into the words we identified in step 3. In your intro, you will
want to define the word. And in all of your points your job is to show how your answer fits the
criterion—this is the essence of extemp. For those debaters out there, it’s like showing how each
of your contentions meets your framework. Imagining you’ve defined the term in your intro
(we’ll do an example of this in a moment), the following should be the schematic of any point in
your speech:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Subpoint A</strong>: The framework of your speech as applied to the context of this point.</li>
<li><strong>Subpoint B</strong>: How the solution/answer presented in this point fulfills the framework set
   forth in A.</li>
<li><strong>Subpoint C</strong>: The impact of the point (this will most likely never change).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re super confused, don’t worry—let’s look at an example below:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>Is Donald Trump making a mistake by not giving Nikki Haley a cabinet position?</em></p>
<p><strong>Ambiguous term definition (and your framework!)</strong>: <em>“Mistake: if it will be politically costly to
him in foreign policy.”</em></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When you say this, you will often make sure it is smooth (don’t say the “definition of ___
is…” use a comma splice instead).</p>
<p><strong>Application to a point on experience</strong>:<br>
- <strong>A</strong>: Experience is crucial to navigating global geopolitics, especially with two global conflicts
  in place. 
  <em>Here you are connecting experience to your framework of global political cost.</em><br>
- <strong>B</strong>: Nikki Haley, having served as the UN ambassador during the previous administration,
  has the unique experience that Marco Rubio does not have as senator. <em>Now you prove that her experience is unique.</em><br>
- <strong>C</strong>: Impact of lack of experience to U.S. geopolitics (<em>why is foreign policy so important</em>).</p>
<p>Crafting a framework means that your first subpoint of each point in your speech is almost
always complete when you draft your intro. Usually, the connection is theoretical in nature (but
solvency questions are a bit different—be creative). In every case your framework in your intro
should have the following three properties:
1. <strong>Concise</strong>: Needs to fit in your background.
2. <strong>Specific</strong>: Make sure it tells the mechanics.
3. <strong>Objective</strong>: It should reduce the ambiguity and be able to be used within each point.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: This must be one sentence in your intro!</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="5-follow-the-implicit-recipes-for-your-points">5. Follow the implicit recipes for your points</h3>
<p>Now, here’s where that news reading and theory is actually useful! Generally, as I said in step 4
each point will always have one element of the framework. Each of the three points in your
speech should have a pattern based on each category (but the internal structure should look like
what I said in step 4). I’ll highlight one of the categories that I think is the hardest and give a
brief explanation for the other two (this is the internal substructure recipe for each point):</p>
<h4 id="solvency-my-favorite">Solvency (my favorite!):</h4>
<p>These questions ask for a solution to a problem. Begin by thinking about
what is the foundational problem the question is asking you to solve. Then, the three points you
create should broadly adhere to the syntax of <strong>“achieving x through y.”</strong> The <em>x</em> here is the medium
by which the problem is solved, and <em>y</em> is the specific mechanism. When you actually read out
your speech, you will only likely say <em>y</em> in your roadmap and as your tag for each point, and
that’s okay, but starting with this syntax means that you have a clear mechanistic connect to
answering the question.</p>
<p><strong>What each point needs to achieve</strong>:
- Identify the sub-problem (leverage the framework to explain why it’s a problem).
- Describe a solution with specifics (numbers, mechanics, how will it solve, etc.) <strong>AND</strong> show
  that the problem is fixed by the solution you ascribe (previous examples, quantitative studies,
  etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: (my definition for revitalize in the intro would be <em>“continue the momentum of gun
policy movements despite the new political environment”</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>How can the U.S. revitalize gun control legislation in a Trump presidency?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Point</strong>: Increasing local social groups for gun control.</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>: <em>Interest groups drive policy change at all levels of government; continuing interest
    group momentum means that the momentum of gun policy movements will continue.</em></li>
<li><strong>B</strong>: <em>Social groups are pivotal to interest groups (Moms Demand Action as an example),
    so increasing the meeting frequency signals a continued action campaign; already worked
    in local levels.</em></li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: <em>Impact of gun control continues, even if the political environment is no longer sound
    for action.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="predictive-questions">Predictive questions:</h4>
<p>Your A subpoint should bridge a theory that connects a way in which your framework could be achieved; then, the B subpoint talks about how that will be achieved with the current course. In other words, your A point is a model of sorts. These models can be sources from political science papers, books, the past (so news articles), or anything that could be extrapolated. Your B point applies this model to the current situation. You want your A point to bridge between your status quo and framework.</p>
<h4 id="cost-benefit-analysis-questions">Cost-benefit analysis questions:</h4>
<p>Your A subpoint should talk about the end goal (which is your framework). Your B subpoint should analyze why it helps/hurts that framework if we pursue the desired approach in the question. In my opinion, these are the easiest questions to analyze since the question already gives you most of the constraints (so not that fun in terms of creativity).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>AND… that’s it. Those are the five steps to actually answering the question:
1) Type of question.
2) Ask the why.
3) Find the burdens.
4) Compose the framework.
5) Follow the recipe.</p>
<p>Every extemp question is fundamentally an engineering problem (or, at least, that’s how I like
to think of it). There are substructures you may have learned in the past, but those are ultimately
elementary formulas derived from this approach. But analyzing it in this way means that you
really understand what’s going on behind the scenes. Extemp is about having fun, being
creative, and, ultimately, being a starting point to solving problems. This five-step approach is
meant to give you a little bit of a lens so you don’t start from square one and helps your
brainstorming process.</p>
