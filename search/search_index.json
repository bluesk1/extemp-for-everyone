What does that mean? Well, it actually doesn't mean much. Because a lot of extemp is just using your creativity to come up with solutions. However, having a systematic way for coming up with these solutions creates a bit of constraint that you can use. There are two primary foci for extemp speeches: content and delivery. Every extemper will struggle with both at different points in your career. And, unfortunately, it's a lot like playing a game of whack-a-mole, because when one thing is all good, you have to get to the other one to perfect it. All said and done, extemp is an unforgettable activity; the thrill, the creativity, and possibilities are truly endless. There are two crucial elements to a good extemp speech:</p> <ol> <li>Answering the question (i.e., good analysis)</li> <li>Delivery that is able to communicate complex ideas in a palletable way.<sup>1</sup></li> </ol> <p>In terms of structure, we will cover the theoritical parts of extemp that would let you handle almost any speech, and then move onto some more stable parts of American/international institutions (i.e., models) that you can leverage in your speeches to make them easier to compose and think through.

In this short article, I\u2019m going to talk about a five-step approach that is sequential that you can use to handle ANY question you receive\u2014and I guarantee you will answer the question.

Understand the type of question that is being asked","text":"<p>In extemp there are three types of questions: solvency, prediction, and cost-benefit analysis. EVERY single extemp question can be categorized into these three types. Let\u2019s take a set of example extemp questions (most are courtesy of Extemp Central) and sort them through as an example:</p> Solvency Prediction Cost-Benefit Analysis How can a war between Ethiopia and Eritrea be avoided? Will Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president be less chaotic than the first? Should the Department of Education be abolished? What role, if any, should AI play in the use of nuclear weapons? Were economic or cultural issues more influential in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election? Should there be greater federal regulation of social media content? How can the U.S. revitalize gun control legislation in a Trump presidency? Is Donald Trump making a mistake by not giving Nikki Haley a cabinet position? Does Jerome Powell deserve another term as Federal Reserve Chairman? <p>Solvency questions are classified by a question that asks you for a solution to a problem (and for you to prove your solution will work\u2014policy people, you know you love these questions!).</p> <p>Prediction questions are questions that ask you to either proactively or retroactively analyze a solution and apply models (we\u2019ll talk about these models in step 5) to spell out why you think this will happen. These types of questions lend themselves nicely to understanding why something occurs and if your current situation meets that criteria (step 5 will tell you more).</p> <p>Cost-benefit analysis otherwise known as yes/no questions (not always, though) have a policy given to you, but requires you to evaluate whether that policy should be implemented or not based on your own criteria (but the question may provide some too!

Doing this makes a speech feel complete. It\u2019s like going from knowing about programming to understanding how it works under-the-hood. Burdens are what you need to have said by the end of the speech (to that end, we will use frameworks in step 4, but we do need to identify burdens to start). Understanding how it works under-the-hood is the magic sauce that most extempers take time to implement. And you will likely find that identifying burdens seems so superfluous but step 4 will actually use this. I feel that starting with examples is the best way to begin. The blue words are your so-called burdens:</p> <ul> <li>Will Donald Trump\u2019s second term as president be less chaotic than the first?</li> <li>Is Donald Trump making a mistake by not giving Nikki Haley a cabinet position?</li> <li>How can the U.S. revitalize gun control legislation in a Trump presidency?</li> <li>Does Jerome Powell deserve another term as Federal Reserve Chairman?</li> </ul> <p>Before reading on, I want you to look at these examples, and see what unites these terms. Do you find the pattern?</p> <p>The first part is the question term and each term specifies the category of question (see step 1 again for this) and what you will need to do. So, when categorizing the question, you pay attention to this initial term. Which questions (not shown here) also carry an important burden that I think is important to highlight, even if they might be categorized with prediction. Specifically it introduces the burden of comparison. Immediately when seeing which you should think of the candidates and the framework to compare\u2014this will come together in your mind in the next step. IMPORTANT: in comparative questions, if you do not bring up examples of other things you are comparing with, you have NOT answered the question.</p> <p>The second part is, perhaps, the most important.

For those debaters out there, it\u2019s like showing how each of your contentions meets your framework.
